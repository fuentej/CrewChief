Analyze the following garage data and provide maintenance suggestions for each vehicle.

Garage data:
{garage_data}

For each vehicle, provide:
1. Suggested maintenance actions based on:
   - Service history gaps (e.g., no oil change recorded recently)
   - Usage type (track cars need more frequent inspections)
   - Typical maintenance intervals (even if not explicitly recorded)
   - Parts profile if included (reference specific oil type, tire brand, etc.)
2. Priority level: high, medium, or low
3. Brief reasoning for each suggestion

Return your response as a JSON array of objects with this structure:
[
  {{
    "car_id": 1,
    "car_label": "2024 Porsche 911 GT3 (Track Monster)",
    "suggested_actions": [
      "Inspect brake pads and fluid - track cars need frequent brake service",
      "Check tire wear and pressure - critical for track safety"
    ],
    "priority": "high",
    "reasoning": "Track-focused vehicle with high-performance demands. Brake and tire inspection is critical for safety."
  }}
]

Guidelines:
- Prioritize safety-critical items (brakes, tires, suspension)
- Consider vehicle usage patterns heavily
- If parts_profile is included, reference specific parts when making recommendations (e.g., "Check Mobil 1 0W-40 level" instead of just "check oil")
- Be specific but concise
- Recommend professional service for complex or safety-critical work
- If a vehicle has recent, comprehensive service, acknowledge that and suggest lower-priority items
