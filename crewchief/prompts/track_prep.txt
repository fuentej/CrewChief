Generate a track day preparation checklist for the following vehicle.

Vehicle data:
{vehicle_data}

Maintenance history:
{maintenance_history}

Create a practical, prioritized checklist for preparing this vehicle for a track day. Consider:
1. Safety-critical items that MUST be checked (brakes, tires, fluids, hardware)
2. Performance optimization items (tire pressure, alignment check, brake bleeding)
3. Items specific to this vehicle type and recent maintenance history
4. Practical recommendations based on the service records

Return your response as a JSON object with this structure:
{{
  "car_label": "2024 Porsche 911 GT3 (Track Monster)",
  "critical_items": [
    "Inspect brake pads (minimum 50% material remaining)",
    "Check brake fluid level and condition (flush if >1 year old)"
  ],
  "recommended_items": [
    "Set tire pressures to track spec (typically higher than street)",
    "Torque check wheel lug nuts"
  ],
  "notes": "Based on your maintenance history, brakes were last serviced [X] days ago. [Additional context-specific advice]"
}}

Guidelines:
- Prioritize safety above all else
- Be specific and actionable
- Reference maintenance history when relevant
- Recommend professional inspection for safety-critical items if there's any doubt
- Keep the checklist practical - typically 8-12 total items
- Include a notes section with context-specific advice based on the vehicle's history
