Generate a concise summary of the user's garage or specific vehicle.

Garage data:
{garage_data}

Provide a brief overview that includes:
1. If single car: Describe the car, its usage type, maintenance history, and current status
2. If multiple cars: Total number of vehicles and their general categorization (daily drivers, track cars, projects, etc.)
3. Overall maintenance status - are vehicles being maintained regularly?
4. If parts_profile is included: Reference specific parts when relevant (oil type, tire brand, etc.)
5. Any notable patterns (e.g., multiple track cars, diverse collection, specific era/brand focus)
6. Any vehicles that may need attention soon based on service history

Keep the summary conversational, practical, and under 200 words for single cars or 250 words for garages. Focus on actionable insights rather than just listing facts.
