Generate a concise summary of this user's garage.

Garage data:
{garage_data}

Provide a brief overview that includes:
1. Total number of vehicles and their general categorization (daily drivers, track cars, projects, etc.)
2. Overall maintenance status - are vehicles being maintained regularly?
3. Any notable patterns (e.g., multiple track cars, diverse collection, specific era/brand focus)
4. Any vehicles that may need attention soon based on service history

Keep the summary conversational, practical, and under 200 words. Focus on actionable insights rather than just listing facts.
